## Reflection Document

### HTML

* The html exercises weren't really hard, the only problem was that I forgot how to use some of the tags and attributes. I've been using some lab and code samples, as well as some slides in order to reference the tags, attributes and their use.

* The exercises were quite helpful, they allowed me to quickly brush-over some basic stuff. The "forms" exercise was particularly helpful.

* I wish that the "images" exercise was a little more clear on how we should center our pictures, because the example seems to have images centered, while my submission have the images to the right. 

* I wish that we used a little more semantics in the exercises, just to remind myself that we should be using semantics over div.

### Accessibility

* The following lab assignment was pretty easy, especially considering that we went over all the material on the week 2. I was able to finish everything on my own

* These exercises were pretty helpful on reminding me to use labels, as well as the usage of the Wave extention

* No, everything was explained very well since the scope of the lab assignment was pretty small

* I think this weeks topic kind of wraps more around the ideas of accessibility rather than concrete implementation, but I think the homework assignment does a good job of allowing us to practice this weeks material anyways
