## Reflection Document

# Questions

### HTML

- The html exercises weren't really hard, the only problem was that I forgot how to use some of the tags and attributes. I've been using some lab and code samples, as well as some slides in order to reference the tags, attributes and their use.

- The exercises were quite helpful, they allowed me to quickly brush-over some basic stuff. The "forms" exercise was particularly helpful.

- I wish that the "images" exercise was a little more clear on how we should center our pictures, because the example seems to have images centered, while my submission have the images to the right.

- I wish that we used a little more semantics in the exercises, just to remind myself that we should be using semantics over div.

### Accessibility

- The following lab assignment was pretty easy, especially considering that we went over all the material on the week 2. I was able to finish everything on my own.

- These exercises were pretty helpful on reminding me to use labels, as well as the usage of the Wave extention. This was a pretty helpful exercise overall, just as a good refreshment on the accessibility.

- No, everything was explained very well since the scope of the lab assignment was pretty small. Well, would be good if we had a second exercise because accessibility seem to be an important concept in front-end development.

- I think this weeks topic kind of wraps more around the ideas of accessibility rather than concrete implementation, but I think the homework assignment does a good job of allowing us to practice this weeks material anyways. I mean, there's only one exercise, probably a second exercise wouldn't hurt much.

### CSS

- This lab was pretty hard, I had to go over the class slides a lot. Though, I didn't use the solutions.

- The lab was very helpful, css exercises are important since we would be interacting with it a lot. I would say that the media queries were pretty helpful, I was wondering how developers allow for pc to mobile resizing.

- The layout exercise was pretty hard, I know that the solution is just essentially changing one rule, but finding that in the slides took quite some time.

- I think we had a lot of exercises this week, so I wouldn't think we need more to learn better.

### Flexbox

- We had to apply flexbox on six containers, doing many different rules, so I really used a lot of slide materials. But I haven't used the solutions.

- The exercises were really helpful, flexbox seems to be a complicated subject, so having 6 various applications of it is great.

- I think the explanations were pretty good for this lab exercise, so nothing much should be explained better.

- I mean flexbox is an extensive subject, maybe comparing it with the other display rules can be beneficial.

### CSS Grid

- The grid exercise wasn't that complicated, I was peeking onto the slides sometimes, but I mostly used what I remembered from the lecture.

- The exercises were very helpful, particularly the grid, I didn't know you can do such things with the grid using css.

- Wish the areas were explained better, their syntax looks so weird in css, looks like a mini-grid in css file itself.

- Maybe explaining grid areas would be good, but otherwise everything was pretty good.

### Bootstrap

- Not going to lie, but the bootstrap exercises had me looking up the slides, documentation, and then the provided solutions.

- The exercises were helpful, but been a bit hard for me. Though the grid was helpful.

- I would say some more explanations would've been great, but for the most part I think I just had to look through the slides better.

- Maybe an exercise on how to make a good navbar with bootstrap, but there are so many classes in bootstrap.

### Javascript

- I really liked this lab, and I've been just using the slides to look-up the function references.

- I found these exercises to be very helpful to go over the basics of javascript, especially the object exercises.

- I wish the async aspect would've been explored more, but maybe this is just all there is to it.

- I think this is a good set of exercises for one lab about the Javascript honestly, I don't think there's a need to expand it.

### Jquery

It was an optional lab so I've skipped it.
